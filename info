Colors by nale12

Intended for 50 px panel size but slightly smaller panel sizes works as well. 
Very colorish icons are recommended by the author but the theme can look really good even if less colorish icons are used. In that case you might want to change the window list style to Elegance and decrease the window list background opacity.

There is a matching dock theme also named Colors.
